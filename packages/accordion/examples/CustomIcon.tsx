        Three common ways for a prospective owner to acquire a dog is from pet
        shops, private owners, or shelters. A pet shop may be the most
        convenient way to buy a dog. Buying a dog from a private owner allows
        you to assess the pedigree and upbringing of your dog before choosing to
        take it home. Lastly, finding your dog from a shelter, helps give a good
        home to a dog who may not find one so readily.
